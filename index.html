<h1 class="title">Chorale Story</h1>
<h1 class="subtitle">Seattle Tour 2018</h1>
<h2>March 24&#8211;29</h2>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, a premier small vocal ensemble called the Stanford Chamber Chorale departed their beloved Leland Stanford Jr. University for Seattle, Washington, for their annual tour.</p>
<p>They took a magical train to Seattle, because Steve had a feeling that trains would be safer. This feeling came from a Buzzfeed article he found on Facebook about how planes have too many hydraulic leaks.</p>
<p>The flight attendants were very sympathetic to the fact that the singers just finished off a brutal winter quarter. They offered them praise readily, congratulating Toby for licking his entire packet of pretzels clean.</p>
<p>Also noteworthy was the arrival of Julian Kusnadi. Behold, another male who wears his baseball cap backwards! The men, especially Kos, are instantly taken with happiness at the sight of his trendy getup and at the sound of his powerful voice. This mysterious creature’s voice can span many octaves and is useful for echolocation, which really came in handy when the group was attempting to find Lorin’s cellphone. Turns out this new specimen in our midst could also use the strength of his resonance to direct traffic as the singers loaded onto an illegally parked charter bus—or at least scare the other cars away from approaching—it really is an unearthly ability this mysterious being possesses! Julian could even use his hypnotic voice to induce a deep and dreamless sleep for Chorale that first night.</p>
<p>After a slumber so deep and so immersive, the singers wake up happy and at-peace—except for Alexis and Alexis, who have discovered they have switched bodies!</p>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>In all reality, Alexis I. was so happy because she had always been saying that she wished she could be a bass. Alexis R. was upset—he hated the way he said, “Mom,” so he prayed relentlessly to the moon, but it did not help.</p>
<p>After some meditation to Steve’s slack key music, it came to him—he would have to keep in touch with his Midwestern side before he and Alexis switched back. He decided to enlist in the help of Borup, who understood and loved everything Midwestern, even the corn. Lorin was shocked that no one believed she lived in the Midwest. She became so salty that she stole the white elephant and hid it where it wouldn’t be found. Realizing that stealing the elephant hadn’t brought her joy, she decided to sing “The Alto’s Lament.” When the waiter was finally able to see that Lorin’s table truly was the most talented, he decided to give Alexis and Alexis the fusion potion that would switch them back, to save Lorin from insanity.</p>
<p>Whatever became of the white elephant still remains a mystery.</p>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>But Chorale was up to the task of trying to solve it! After all, they had a few minutes to kill before their table was ready. Toby sprinted down every street in Seattle, keeping his eyes peeled for a white elephant, but to no avail. Julia scaled the Amazon Biospheres, hoping to have a wider field of view: still no luck. You’d think it would be hard to hide something as conspicuous as an oddly colored pachyderm! Chorale was getting desperate—they needed to return this noble steed they had borrowed from Dr. Nirund hoping it would be a handy way to get around. Thus, if they couldn’t find it soon, their next best mode of transit was an overlarge bus with DVD screens in every row that played the NYANCAT song on repeat. The minutes ticked down… Minseung phoned his Seattle network and had them check around: no dice. Chris tried to track the elephant’s iPhone on Find My Friends, but the darned thing was out of battery. As a last-ditch effort, Julia climbed all the way to the top of the Space Needle, but the only new thing she spotted was a new outdoor cafeteria Amazon had recently built just for the sentient AI-bots that worked in the Biosphere to use. Time was up: the table was ready. Dejected, Chorale took their seats and lamented that they’d be getting around by overlarge bus. Granted, it blocked a lot of lanes of traffic, but at least it had outlets. Humming the pleasant new descant for “Hail, Stanford, Hail,” under their breath, they opened their menus.</p>
<p>It was time to decide what to order.</p>
<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p>Requests spilled forth as only they could from the most ravenous crowd to ever beset a ramen restaurant—a choir on its first day of tour: rangoon, miso ramen, friend wonton dumplings, potato cakes, pork shoulder sliders, spaghetti (well, when in Seattle…). Steve glanced towards his wallet. Perhaps the SCC’s hunger for appetizers could consume even the university’s funding; if this was how hungry they were after 1.5 hours of rehearsal, what would come in the next five days? Whilst chopsticks clacked and conversations grew, voices from outside crept into the atmosphere. A server, likely a superfan of the Pitch Perfect movies, schemed to make the choir break forth into a musical duel: three tables alike in dignity if not in vocal distribution, all wieling concert repertoir as to prove themselves the most virtuosic. Hearing the challenge of the masses, Steve summoned his fortitude; urged by the praise of his colleagues, he made the prnouncement for the group, giving voice to the idea all twenty-five vocalists held in their heads: “Uhhh… no.”</p>
<p>Instead of waging a fruitless musical conflict, the SCC rallied their full voices and stomaches to regale the chef with happy birthday wishes; granted, the four-part harmony was perhaps too complex for those unacquainted with modern choral songwriting, and the SCC didn’t seem to agree whether the chef’s name was Kyle or Ryan… but that’s being picky. Their hearts and appetites contented, the choir traipsed its way back to the Loyal Inn. The hot tub room was about to fill with a more musical crowd.</p>
<p>Pop quiz: how do you play cards by the hot tub side without ruining the cards?</p>
<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p><em>Oh, shit,</em> thought Alexis. <em>I don’t remember any of the water-proofing chemistry I studied. How am I going to answer this question? How am I going to pass chem?</em></p>
<p>Now breathing frantically, she panicaked. <em>I’m not going to pass. I’m not going to pass chem!!!</em> [She screamed.]</p>
<p>All of a sudden, she heard a calm voice whisper, “Are you alright?”</p>
<p>Squinting in the direction of the voice, Alexis saw a figure like Julia.</p>
<p>“It’s spring break, hun,” Julia said. “You had another finals nightmare, huh?”</p>
<p>Alexis wiggled to sit upright in her bed.</p>
<p>“Ugh, that was so real. I’m going to take a walk to destress.”</p>
<p>Stepping out the door, she considered tomorrow’s workout—21-Day Cleanse’s arm day—and where she would eat to fit with the meal plan. Then, out of the corner of her eye, she spotted a bag of cookies outside a hotel room door. Resisting the temptation, she continued walking, now counting the people planning to run with her. But, out of nowhere a basket of cookies appeared in front of her feet.</p>
<p><em>BAM.</em></p>
<p>She tripped, and fell into what must have been a thousand and four hundred warm, chocolate cookies.</p>
<p>“Where are all these midnight cookies coming from?”</p>
<p>Pulling her face from chocolate, she spotted Olivia waving her hands and fabricating cookies from air.</p>
<p>“Olivia, <em>you</em> are the cookie-making wizard of the moon?!”</p>
<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<p>Olivia’s eyes darted to the floor at this accusation.</p>
<p>“No…” she defended.</p>
<p>A cookie fell out of the folds of her dress and rolled across the stage. The audience, which had grown exponentially from its initial size of seven people, gasped. Alexis siezed the cookie from the floor and held it above his head for all to see.</p>
<p>“She lies! She <em>is</em> the cookie-making wizard of the moon!”</p>
<p>The audience murmered in agreement.</p>
<p>“No, I swear! That cookie is from the amazingly kind hotel staff!” Olivia pleaded.</p>
<p>Cooper joined Alexis’s attack: “Then what was it doing in your dress?” he demanded.</p>
<p>“In case I got hungry! We all hide stuff in our dresses. There’s so much extra fabric!”</p>
<p>“Is this true?” asked Alexis. “Shake out your uniforms!”</p>
<p>All the Chorale shook out their uniforms. Nothing fell from any of the dresses, though Luke spilled three juggling balls from his tuxedo, and Toby chased after the bottle of purple nail polish that fell from his.</p>
<p>An Andrew Forsyth lookalike stood up from the last row of the audience. “Olivia didn’t shake out her dress!” he shouted.</p>
<p>Every head in the room turned toward Olivia.</p>
<p>Julia spoke up: “Well, shake out your dress!”</p>
<p>Reluctantly, Olivia grabbed her dress and shook it. It began to glow a brilliant blue. Outside the chapel, the moon grew twice as big and thrice as bright, flooding the trees with moonlight. A smell of chocolate filled the chapel, and a hundred cookies burst from Olivia’s dress.</p>
<p>“Ahah! She is the cookie-making wizard of the moon!” Julia exclaimed. “We must banish her!”</p>
<p>Again, the Andrew Forsyth lookalike stood in the audience.</p>
<p>He shouted, “Send her back to Hawaii!”</p>
<p>The audience murmered agreement again.</p>
<p>“Wait!” cried Daniel.</p>
<p>He stepped to the edge of the stage and looked into the audience.</p>
<p>“How does the Andrew Forsyth lookalike know that we went to Hawaii? Unless…”</p>
<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<p>Unbeknownst to the current Chorale members, former member Andrew Forsyth had been turned into a covert sleeper agent for an international syndicate of tenors hell-bent on world domination. So covert, in fact, that Julian—one of the organization’s nefarious directors—didn’t even know about it. Forsyth was programmed to become an active agent in response to a series of clicking and other percussive noises, and unfortunately, Winges was in the set list. Just one misplaced “sk!” and… well, the consequences are too dire, of course, to chronicle with any spoken language, as Winges himself knew. For the tenor sleeper agents were armed with the ultimate weapon: an “O” vowel so tall that Steve himself would immediately retire upon hearing it, his ultimate wish fulfilled.</p>
<p>Happily, the Winges was flawless. But the Chorale still faced issues of a dire sort. After their walk around campus, Chris had been forced to give twelve more campus tours by random passers by—“tours de force,” if you will. Jasmine had become imprisoned in a glass café and, as her only chance of salvation lay in a 2-on-2 basketball victory by Eric and Minseung, was beginning to lose hope. Tomorrow’s call had been moved up to 3:45 AM, and the bus reduced to only 16 seats—Cooper took the pencil down from his ear and prepared to check in only the first two thirds of the bleary-eyed singers. Lorin, Amelia, and Courtney had fallen asleep in the hot tub but were found by Alexis and Alexis, who had put aside their differences to start an Amazon competitor called Alexae, with all business planning done in the hotel gym. Darren had been called in to provide some seniority; as Steve had required the basses to act 30 years older at <em>all</em> times, he was already considering retirement.</p>
<p>In short, there was a <em>chor</em>-pus of problems. Prompt action was re-<em>choired</em>. The issues needed to be <em>choraled</em>, and <em>Pulenc</em> it off would mean everyone <em>pitching</em> in.</p>
<p>“How did <em>Vilette</em> this happen??” exclaimed everyone except Borup, who, no longer responsible for check-in, was recording the 10<sup>th</sup> take of Chilcott to bolster his Tinder profile.</p>
<p>So, half-asleep and facing insurmountable odds, Chorale arrived for their early-morning call only to find a cyptic note and a metronome ticking slowly.</p>
<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<p>Darren picked up the note and read it aloud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Stanford Chamber Chorale, <br>
<br>
Though I was originally over the moon with the way you performed my piece, in recent concerts, you’ve gotten rather sloppy. Now, I must have my revenge. This metronome is actually a time bomb that will explode if you do not fulfill my demands in 24 hours. I need 26 limes, 260 tortillas, and 2600 avocados to make my signature dish: ubi caritas tacos. If I don’t have full enjoyment of these felicities by tomorrow, then this metronome will go BOOM! Well, actually, it’ll be more of a “sk-t-li-a-o” sound. <br>
<br>
XOXO, <br>
Mark Winges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Where are we going to find all those ingredients?” Anna cried.
saf</p>
<p>“Can’t we just comply with this lunatic se we don’t get hurt,” British/Francophone Alexis said. “How hard can it be to find some taco ingredients? There’s a Whole Foods around the corner.”</p>
<p>So the Chorale travled to Whole Foods—by bus, of course. It was only 1 minute away, but Steve recommended that they set aside 2 hours, just in case of traffic. Once they arrived, they were surprised to find that none of the items they needed were in stock. Other grocery stores in the area also lacked the foods.</p>
<p>“This is proving to be an impossible task,” Luke said.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost as impossible as the altos getting the ‘New Jerusalem’ part right at the end of “Rockin’ Jerusalem,” Toby added.</p>
<p>Time was running out, and the Chorale was not any closer to bringing Winges his ingredients.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Amelia snapped her fingers and cried, “I’ve got it! Maybe the ingredients can be found in the Amazon Biosphere!”</p>
<p>The Chorale began to walk to the Biosphere, determined to find the objects that would save them from impending doom.</p>
<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<p>The Chorale, in fear of losing everything they’ve worked for and Steve, ran hurriedly.</p>
<p>“It’s a poke center,” yelled Chris. “It’s only a five-dollar investment for a potential gain of a 40-dollar card!”</p>
<p>…some time later…</p>
<p>The doors banged shut behind the group, and the dark and cool air of the Biosphere loomed around the group.</p>
<p>“Bright—morning—bright—morning—…”</p>
<p>Gloomy and monotone voices muttered workds that were antithetical to their undisputed lack of energy. Amidst the ominous atmosphere were palm trees that seemed to have once enjoyed their deserved Palo Alto sun but now symbolized a loss of hope and optimism.</p>
<p>“Oh, I didn’t get even a single shiny card,” Chris muttered, as perhaps the only remaining source of joy had been extinguished.</p>
<p>“Gooood morning! Gud mooorning!” a cheery but sinister voice echoed down from the depths of the palm trees.</p>
<p>“So familiar, but something is off…” Daniel whispered in his tender yet warm voice.</p>
<p>“You have three axes… one through the top of your head, one through your belly button, and one through the hips about three inches below your belly button…”</p>
<p>“It’s Steve!” Delaney yelled in her usual joyful and cheery voice, even though the three lines that were mentioned don’t <em>actually</em> intersect.</p>
<p>“Steve Sano? His voice… something is odd,” muttered Stephanie.</p>
<p>The sinishter voice responded: “I am no Steve Sano, hahaha! I AM Steve Sayyno.”</p>
<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<p>The ground tremored, the boiling air sang, as energy burst forth from the three-plane intersection deep within Steve’s abdomen. Then suddenly a flash of light, and there stood Steve in Super Saiyan mode. Simultaneously he emitted bass notes as luscious as James and soprano as clear as Jasmine, no “ooo… I do not have those this morning” necessary.</p>
<p>The warm, fatherly tint in Steve’s eyes had disappeared like fog dissolving into moon. Fearing his newfound form, Chorale attempted to flee. Unfortunately, Lorin had left her phone in the bathroom and could not bear to leave the scene. Hannah glanced back, hesitating for only a fraction of a second before deciding, “Hmph, not my job.”</p>
<p>Minseung, seemingly unfazed, giggled infectiously. Chorale immediately sought high ground—looking on to the horizon at the Space Needle. Upon reaching this modern-day Tower of Babel whose summit was lost in the clouds, and totally not underwhelming, Julia preemptively dislocated her shoulder and lept onto the needle, scaling it faster than Alexis finishes a Juul pod. The rest of the Chorale took the elevator, and on the long ride up, started thinking maybe it was finally a good time to discuss something very important but for which they’d never had the time… appro—<em>ring, ring</em></p>
<p>“Guys, it’s Lorin. I made it out and am in the Biosphere. There’s something here everyone needs to see…”</p>
<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<p>At that moment, the phone cut out and Lorin looked past the greenery to the Seattle Skyline. The Biosphere had been transported to the top of the Space Noodle.</p>
<p>As the others put down the phone in fearful silence, a sinister Voice (that sounded oddly like Jeff Bezos) echoed from the very ground under their feet.</p>
<p>“You’re too late! There’s no way you’ll save your friend now!”</p>
<p>“Oh no!” shouted Hannah.</p>
<p>“Capitalism!” Julia yelled.</p>
<p>“What are we going to do?” cried Olivia.</p>
<p>“Sing some tags,” Julian shouted triumphantly, not skipping a beat.</p>
<p>“At a time like this?!” Alexis Ivec responded, her incredulity palpable.</p>
<p>“Yes! I have a plan.”</p>
<p>As the heroes made for the nearest exit (Jeremy lagging behind—something about a shiny swablu), the echoing Voice began to laugh, “Ha! You’ll never stop me with your silly songs!”</p>
<h2>Chapter 12</h2>
<p>Realizing that their vocal prowess could not help them defeat their nemesis, the Chorale quickly assessed their other skills.</p>
<p>Eric turned to the basses and said, “Perhaps we can defeat the Voice by constantly delaying it by showing up late, eventually forcing it to leave us behind.”</p>
<p>They nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chris and Jeremy were discussing the best card game they could challenge the Voice to play. James wondered where he could find a tractor with which he could run over the Voice and asked Courtney if she knew anybody nearby who might have one. Courtney immediately assembled a list of 200 of her BFFs in the area that could come to Chorale’s aid.</p>
<p>Cooper began to put his skill for critiquing film/music to use by writing an eloquent roast to shame the Voice into submission, with Delaney over his shoulder calmly explaining that diplomacy and tasteful flattery might have more positive results. Kos thought he might be able to snore the Voice to death via sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>Lily stood by, watching the chaos around her before finally yelling, “Wait! I know how Chorale can defeat this mysterious voice!”</p>
<h2>Chapter 13</h2>
<p>“Chorale can teach them the wisdom of the moon—quick, someone check outside to see if the moon is out!”</p>
<p>Steve quickly ran outside, but unfortunately the moon was completely obscured by the construction cranes in downtown Amazon Land. Steve returned inside and we all knew that the only thing that could stop the chaos of the high schoolers was a perfect execution of the Winges “Fog Dissolving into Moon.”</p>
<p>Jasmine gave a perfect A at 440 Hz, and we began to sing through the t’s, sk’s, and trills. However, the first time the basses sang, they were flat. The chaos from the high schoolers was like never before, and the mystery Voice presented itself as an overly-inquisitive high schooler who wanted to stump 25 Stanford students.</p>
<p>The high schooler declared, “If you do not answer the question correctly, you will all be stuck in high school—forever!”</p>
<p>Thankfully, Courtney and Alexis were able to answer all the high schooler’s questions and Chorale was able to leave. We paraded out of the school led by Lorin and Daniel singing their solos. Steve was unsatified with the tuning and locked us in the hallway for one hour until we got it right. Then, as a punishment, we had to endure the freezing cold at the UW campus amidst the cherry blossoms. Thankfully, Minseung was an expert of the UW campus, so knew of a way out.</p>
<p>Minseung was able to lead Chorale to safety by taking us through a secret passageway under one of the cherry blossom trees.</p>
<h2>Chapter 14</h2>
<p>Of course, this secret passage’s existence makes perfect sense given that it is UW’s connection to the Seattle secret underground city.</p>
<p>Jasmine, thoroughly unimpressed by the city’s touristy appeal, decided to leave early and ended up in Seattle’s 156<sup>th</sup> Starbucks. Jeremy and Chris were miserable in the Seattle underground, but only because there was no cell service down there and they were thus unable to play Pokémon Go. The underground was an absolute labyrinth of catacombs, and even with Minseung’s brave tour guiding skills the Chorale found itself lost. Just as a delerious James attempted to rationalize who we should cannibalize first, a tiny blue smurf redirected the choir to an exit on the waterfront.</p>
<p>Tobin was impressed by the waterfront’s massive ferris wheel and wanted to see the view from the summit; however, too impatient to wait for the wheel’s slow rotation, Toby instead scaled the wheel’s northern face, slipped on a random eggplant and fell to an untimely death.</p>
<p>Courtney, as the Chorale’s vice president (by really president), was the most affected by Tobin’s death, but Kos, as the Chorale’s actual democratically-elected president, thought up a quick solution and ran to the nearest Amazon building where he was able to procure an early-access model of the new Amazon Tobin™️, the world’s first entriely lifelike, synthetic person who was a much more realistic version than the other robot that replaced Tobin after he died two years ago in Nottingham.</p>
<p>Steve was thankful for this good fortune, seeing as he really didn’t want to be forced to rely on any more tenor replacement alumni than he had to.</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, Delaney’s phone started to ring, and while she didn’t recognize the number, she felt a strange, almost cosmic force compelling her to answer.</p>
<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
<p>She picked up the phone and heard an iksome voice begin, “Congratulations. You have been selected…”</p>
<p>Her heart sank, but then…</p>
<p>“…to receive a magical vocal power.”</p>
<p><em>A what?!</em></p>
<p>“From now on, whenever you sing, the hair of everyone within earshot will stand straight up (whether girl or guy) and will grow 1 inch per minute.”</p>
<p>Delaney was quite dumbfounded, and to be honest, quite incredulous. But who ever got marketing calls conferring magical powers? Just then, Daniel walked by and Delaney thought he might be a good candidate to try her new power on. She began to hum and Daniel’s hair immediately stood on end. Daniel froze in his tracks. He figured (being an erudite grad student) that the only way his hair could have stood on end was if he had just been struck by lightning. Only trouble was, he had not been hurt at all. Delaney stopped humming almost as soon as she began and was now attempting to detangle her hair. She had not bargained that <em>her</em> hair would also be affected by the power. Delaney walked over to Daniel to see if he was alright. They both agreed that they must have been hit by lightning, and that was that. Delaney was too excited about the potential of her new power to leak the news just yet. Shortly thereafter, it was call time for our evening concert, and we all met in the hotel lobby. Delaney was trying to think about the best way to prank people. She considered singing right as she got onto the bus to make everyone’s hair hit the ceiling, but it had been an early morning, and sleep got the better of her. Daniel started telling Kos about his unusual run-in with lightning earlier that day, as Darren and Cooper looked on.</p>
<p>Cooper, Darren, and Kos could not understand how a Chorale member had been struck by lightning while in the hotel…</p>
<h2>Chapter 16</h2>
<p>…but then they saw the pole that Toby had mysteriously erected in his room to practice his trapeze skills in preparation for an upcoming Peter Pan audition. As smoke and dust from the vaporized Toby wafted through the room, Kos took a big whiff and slowly surveyed the scene. It was clear that in their shock, the Chorale members had retreated to their most basic instincts. Courney was crouched in the corner, giggling; Julian sang all 4 lines of a tag simultaneously; Jasmine muttered quietly to herself about social justice and going a quarter-tone flat on every song, and the ghostly voice of Ben Musachio cried, “Game faces!” faintly in the distance as a cold Seattle wind blew through the room.</p>
<p>Suddenly Cooper jumped up and shouted at the assembled singers.</p>
<p>“Everyone, I’ve written an overly detailed review of all the types of lightning that might have hit Toby! This was an example of 50,000-volt post-bebop ball lightning.”</p>
<p>The singers suppressed their urge to hiss at any comments from a Yalie, and continued listening.</p>
<p>“There’s only one way to recover from this type of lightning strike. We must place Toby’s ashes in the mouth of a halibut from Pike Place Market, sprinkle it with coffee grounds from the first Starbucks, and dunk it in the waters of Elliot Bay.”</p>
<p>A glimmer of hope and E major overtone gradually filled the room.</p>
<p>Stephanie and Olivia swept Toby’s ashes into their music folders and set out for Pike Place to find the magic halibut that could bring him back to life.</p>
<h2>Chapter 17</h2>
<p>Now, Stephanie and Olivia were rather concerned with this turn of events, but they set out regardless, convinced that Toby’s indomitable spirit and boundless energy would prevail in the end. As Stephanie and Olivia were walking past the library, they saw Cooper and Minseung coming out of the library. Having been informed of the events through the Chorale Slack, Cooper had rushed to the library in order to compile a list of “10 Best Halibut for Resurrecting Incinerated Friends.” Armed with this new knowledge, the group continued on to the Pike Street Market, picking up James, Luke, Alexis R., and Kos along the way.</p>
<p>The group made it the rest of the way with nothing else going wrong, and in a stroke of luck Cooper saw the best halibut for resurrecting incinerated friends at the fish-throwing place. As the man prepared to throw the halibut, Kos demonstrated his considerable “street ball” skills by catching the fish mid-air and brought up his Chorale four steals to 2.</p>
<p>After successfully evading the group of angry fishermen, the Chorale members were at a loss for how they could actually use the magic halibut. Fortunately, Cooper also happened to be an expert in sorcery and witchcraft and knew that the best way to resurrect someone with a magic halibut was by throwing the fish back into the sea while singing the recently deceased’s favorite chord. So Chorale joined hands and sang a delightfully mellow D♭ chord as the fish was thrown back to the sea. Unfortunately, the basses had gone flat, as they were wont to do, and while Toby was revived without incident, the sorcery had exacted a far greater cost.</p>
<p>Lily was now possessed by a demon.</p>
<h2>Chapter 18</h2>
<p>The demon took over her mind and forced her to say the most savage things. When the choir visited the high schoolers, the demon made Lily answer questions. When a student asked what she liked about singing in Chamber Chorale, she responded, “I love being able to sing with people almost twice my age.”</p>
<p>We all knew who she was talking about. Now that the demon was satisfied with its possession of Lily, it quietly exorcised itself from her body. It found a new home in one of the high schoolers. He then proceeded to make the young boy yell out to Darren, “How old are you?!”</p>
<p>Oh, what havoc the demon was causing.</p>
<p>The demon then made its way around to each member of the Chorale during their exchange, ruining the performance. While most people just assumed their horrible performance was due to waking up at 6 in the morning, it was actually the demon’s fault. He stole Jasmine’s high range so that she couldn’t sing the high D. He made Borup mess up his notes for the first time in history. He made the entire choir go flat, sharp, and just plain out of tune. But the demon was not prepared for Steve’s hidden trick. He could tell there was something wrong with the choir, so Steve finished off the last song with a big conducting jump. The demon was immediately exorcised and sent back to where it came from. A big relief came over the group.</p>
<p>With the demon gone, the choir continued with their tour.</p>
<h2>Chapter 19</h2>
<p>However, the demon struck again. It possessed (Greek) Kos as he slept and caused him to snore like Satan; not even an exorcist was able to rouse him from his demonic slumbers. Even Cooper was impressed—on his weekly review page of “The Top 10 Snores,” Kos’s snores ranked 3<sup>rd</sup>, slightly behind Darth Vader with an 8.53 out of 10.</p>
<p>In an effort to understand the demon that occupied Kos’s brain and tonsils, Julian, Toby, and Alexis took it upon themselves to go to UW’s Psych 101 class. Turns out the first class of Psych 101 had little to offer on Kos’s unique condition. In the end, the three comrades gave up on Kos, praying that his future loves could cure him. Julian seemed optimistic about the situation. Cool Julian, or ‘Coolian’, is fazed by nothing.</p>
<p>Toby hoped the demon wouldn’t possess his cuticles. They are glorious, really glorious. Cooper gives them a 9.8 on his “The Best Cuticles of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century!”</p>
<p>It seemed the demon would live on in Kos, leaving Alexis truly “Sleepless in Seattle.” However, Seattle wasn’t as sleepless as it seemed…</p>
<h2>Chapter 20</h2>
<p>After a long session of entertaining sassy high schoolers, Chorale was exhausted. They returned to the hotel with the goal of having a nap. They lay down their heads when a loud grumbling noise was heard. What was that? An earthquake? An airplane? No, it was Kos’s snoring. It had gotten so out of hand that the whole building was reverberating. Angry and tired, the rest of Chorale headed out in search of something to do. Alexis Jr. aggreed to paint a picture of the Chorale, so they went down to the water for a nice backdrop. It was a beautiful day. The sun was shining, and Alexis lined the Chorale up to her satisfaction. But then a seal popped its head up from the water. Steve jumped in excitement and went to take a photo, but as he bent over to take the snap, he lost his footing and fell in. Chorale screamed in alarm and looked helplessly around.</p>
<p>Suddenly Toby dove into the water to rescue Steve…</p>
<h2>Chapter 21</h2>
<p>…and was less than surprised to find himself turning into a fish.</p>
<p>“HWAT?!” screamed Jeremy, who was surprised enough the both of them, and he promptly ffffell into the water as well.</p>
<p>“Fffffffrick,” said Alexis (the younger one, but nevertheless the REAL Alexis), and dove in to save Jeremy just as a local fisherman snatched Toby-fish out of the water and threw him past the wide-eyed rest of Chorale (except for the ones in the water… they were also beginning to transform…).</p>
<p>“Is anyone <em>concerned</em> that everyone is turning into fish?” James asked, his sensuous rumble sending tremors deep into the Earth.</p>
<p>“I am a fish, and I am not concerned,” Toby-fish replied from the hands of an unfazed Kos, who’d mistaken him for a hackey sack. “Please put me down.”</p>
<p>So Kos lowered him gently to the ground, and upon touching dry earth Toby-fish began to transform yet again. Though his body remained the same, his former human legs reappeared. All this, it is to be noted, was accompanied by a great rising fog, twisted from the sound’s surface.</p>
<p>“How are we supposed to save them with all this fog in the way?” Hannah asked, mostly to herself.</p>
<p>“And how are we gonna get Toby back as a person?” Daniel Borup wrinkled his brow. “It’s maybe like being a werewolf. A were-fish. After all, Toby seems pretty a-were of his condition.”</p>
<p>“The solution,” Borup continued, gesturing to the were-fish in the sound, “is simple. Fog… dissolving into moon.”</p>
<h2>Chapter 22</h2>
<p>Heather was having a great time, and all of us missed her. Joss is the wizard of the moon (is that a spoiler?).</p>
<p>Anywho, there are apparently were-fish, and we need to figure out the best way to cook them.</p>
<p>“Fog… dissolving into moon?” said Minseung.</p>
<p>“I know we’re in Seattle, but that is some next-level boogie-ass shit,” said Olivia.</p>
<p>Toby and Chris were busy discussing how much energy it would take to heat the fog enough that it would sublimate.</p>
<p>Jasmine was unamused, but secretly into it.</p>
<p>Steve watched and seemed like he wanted to say something, but smiled cryptically instead.</p>
<p>While we were all arguing, Cooper killed all of the were-fish, roasted them over a hickory-wood fire, laid out table settings for 26, and served a four-course dinner to everyone who was paying attention. Darren, Luke, and Eric ate like kings. There were leftovers.</p>
<p>“That was delicious,” said Eric. “Much better than the communion wine and crackers they force me to live off of at the church.”</p>
<p>Darren laughed knowledgably.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Julia rushed over: “Guys I just Yelped were-fish, and turns out you’re not supposed to eat them!”</p>
<p>Darren, Like, Eric, and Cooper are werewolves! Run with it.</p>
<h2>Chapter 23</h2>
<p>They ran with it all the way into the gorge, but were unable to reach the rolling odaiko before the giant taiko drum smashed into the cliffside, shattering with a tt- tt- sksk fp bp do.</p>
<p><em>Ly-uuu…</em>, cried the four werewolves, believing their hopes of returning to their human selves to have been dashed.</p>
<p>But lo, above the cliff the faire sorceress appeared, having heard their cries.</p>
<p>“I love the sun,” she began to sing, and the four werewolves began to transfigure back to their human selves. Their joy increased as they lost their fur, their fangs retreated, and they began to stand upright.</p>
<p><em>Gasp.</em> “I forgot my phone!” the sorceress shouted, arresting the process and leaving Darren, Luke, Eric, and Cooper in a horrific half-human half-wolf state as she ran off.</p>
<p>“Thank god,” she sighed when she finally reunited with her phone. “But now I have to hurry back. Ok, I bet they’d love a relaxing soak in the hot tub when they return!”</p>
<p>So she went to the hot tub room and stuck a finger in the water. “Hm, not very hot.”</p>
<p>She went to the janitorial closet, pulled out Rochat, and deposited him in the lukewarm water, then quickly hurried off with a, “Thanks, Alexis!”</p>
<p>The sorceress returned to the werewolves, but her song was no longer intensely irridescent enough to complete the transformation. So she called on her friends Toby (for his pixie dust) and Jasmine (for her high-D supplement). Their first collective attempt failed. After nearly ten repetitions, Jasmine collapsed from the effort, but they were healed and transported to the Biosphere for continued rest.</p>
<h2>Chapter 24</h2>
<p>The Biosphere was one of the most powerful places in the world, all thanks to the Stanford Chamber Chorale. As people came to seek refuge at the Biosphere, Alexis made magical muffins that restore one’s faith in the sanctity of this world. The other Alexis told guests how English muffins are purely an American creation, when they are only trying to enjoy their magical muffins. While the Alexises cared for guests inside, Cooper, Olivia, and Jasmine worked tirelessly to keep unwanted people out. Cooper interrogated the enemeies, Olivia was a stealthy spy and warrier, and Jasmine created a force field around the Biosphere with her high D (all enemies died of sweetness immediately).</p>
<p>While the rest of Chorale tirelessly worked to help make the Biosphere the next Wakanda, Kos decided he wanted to become one with his cheeseburger spring roll. He didn’t know the legal/business side of doing this, so he asked his best friend Darren for some consulting advice. Darren readily agreed to use his PhD to help his favorite member of Chorale.</p>
<p>And with that, Kos and Darren went to Seattle’s courthouse to officially make Kos one with his cheeseburger spring roll.</p>
<h2>Chapter 25</h2>
<p>“I would like to formally submit my request to become a member of the Protectors of the Amazon’s Sphere,” exclaimed Kos.</p>
<p>The courtroom fell silent. Among the crowd, one could barely see Mr. Sano’s face at the far corner.</p>
<p>“I am sorry, what did you say?” The judge looked super confused and concerned.</p>
<p>Kos, after taking a deep breath, finally said, “Your honor, you might not beleive this. I was just eating this cheeseburger spring roll when my teeth bit into a hard cylinder. It was a golden key. So my friend, Darren, and I followed the instructions, snuck into the new Biosphere, and found this ancient fossil of the same cheeseburger spring roll that seems to prove my worthiness of being inducted into this secret society—the Protectors of the Amazon Sphere. Your honor…”</p>
<p>The echo of his resonant bass voice was interrupted by a shrieking gun shot. The crowd burst into chaos. Darren, covered in the blood of his friend, was in shock. Guards swarmed over to Kos’s body, pressing down his gushing wound.</p>
<p>“Where is the cheeseburger spring roll in his hands?” screamed one of the guards.</p>
<p>They glanced down and saw on Kos’s hand nothing but blood and emptiness.</p>
<p>A shadow, carrying the very roll, disappeared into the sunset of the city of Seattle.</p>
